significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-
tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
