of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.

Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by âˆšdk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
