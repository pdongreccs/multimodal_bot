as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,
learned and fixed [9].
In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:
PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)
PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)
where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding
corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We
chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by
relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of
PEpos.
