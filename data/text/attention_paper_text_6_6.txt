rate over the course of training, according to the formula:
lrate = d−0.5
model · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)
(3)
This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,
and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used
warmup_steps = 4000.

Regularization
We employ three types of regularization during training:
