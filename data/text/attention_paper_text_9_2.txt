prisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the
Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].
In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-
Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

Conclusion
In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on
attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with
multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
