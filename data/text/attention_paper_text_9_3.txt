multi-headed self-attention.
For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based
on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014
English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best
model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.
We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We
plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and
to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs
